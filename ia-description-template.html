<h1>/mlp/ Archive (NDJSON)</h1>

<p>
  This item contains a comprehensive text and metadata archive of the 4chan
  <strong>/mlp/</strong> board, covering the period from the board's creation
  (February 2012) through {currentMonth} {currentYear} (as of the last update).
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The data is stored in <strong>NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON)</strong> format,
  compressed with XZ. Each line represents a single post object as received
  from the desuarchive API <sup><a href="#notes">[1]</a></sup>.
</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>
  Posts were aggregated from multiple archival sources to ensure maximum completeness.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>desuarchive.org:</strong> {desuarchiveCount} posts</li>
  <li><strong>archive.heinessen.com:</strong> {heinessenCount} posts</li>
  <li><strong>arch.b4k.dev:</strong> {b4kCount} posts</li>
  <li><strong>archived.moe:</strong> {archivedMoeCount} posts</li>
  <li><strong>4archive.org:</strong> {fourArchiveCount} posts</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Total Missing Posts:</strong> {missingCount} (as of the latest update).
</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes [1]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Data from <em>archive.heinessen.com</em> was converted to roughly look like
    the desuarchive API response.
  </li>
  <li>
    Same goes for data from <em>4archive.org</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>arch.b4k.dev</em> and <em>archived.moe</em> run the same software as
    desuarchive (FoolFuuka) so their responses were already in "desuarchive format".
  </li>
  <li>
    Posts that could not be retrieved from any known source are represented by
    a placeholder JSON object to maintain continuity (schema described below).
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Missing Post Schema</h4>

  "exception": "Post: not found",
  "timestamp": 1646187447 <span style="color: green;">// Timestamp of when the "post not found" response was received from the API.</span>
}</code></pre>
